# NEETS-Training

On the web there are documents called NEETS "Navy Electricity and Electronics Training Series" consisting of various modules created by the U.S. Navy. These modules are approved for public release with unlimited  distribution.

I am going to attempt to study NEETS 14173 Module 1 to document my understandings, fragmental thoughts, notes, and findings in this repository to hopefully derive expository style essays which are useful to myself and others.

Expect heavy modifications and overhauls.
