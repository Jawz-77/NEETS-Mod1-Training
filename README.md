# NEETS-Training

On the web there are (NEETS) "Navy Electricity and Electronics Training Series" modules created by the U.S. Navy. These modules are approved for public release with unlimited  distribution.

I am going to attempt to study some of these modules in hopes to document my understandings,fragmental thoughts, notes, and findings here to hopefully derive an expository writing style.

Expect heavy modifications over the years.
