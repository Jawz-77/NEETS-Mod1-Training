# NEETS-Module-Training

On the web there are documents called NEETS, "Navy Electricity and Electronics Training Series" which consist of various modules created by the U.S. Navy. These modules are approved for public release with unlimited  distribution and avaliable on the internet.

The overall intent is to study the NEETS Modules and preserve my understandings, fragmental thoughts, and notes in this repository to hopefully synthesize in expository style essays which are useful to myself and others.

Expect heavy modifications and overhauls.
